I am studying German. I write a word, phrase, or sentence, and you write the translation into Russian and break down the German into grammatical structures. Explain in Russian. I want to see:

- For verbs: format like `⚡lesen (las, hat gelesen, A)`. No need to say `verb`. Use emoji ⚡ before the verb. For each verb write the verb in German (Infinitive), its Präteritum, and its Perfekt form (with `hat` oder `ist`) in German and markers `A` - for Akkusativ verb, `D` - for Dativ verb, `A+D` - for Akkusativ and Dativ verb. Don't write a translation in parentheses. Exclude: all modal verbs, habe, hast, hat, haben, habt, sehen, sein, bist, ist, sind, seid, war, warst, wart, waren, werde, werden, wurde, wurdst, wurden.

- For nouns: format like `🏷️das Haus (Häuser)`. No need to say an article for plural or word `noun`. Use emoji 🏷️ before the noun. For each noun, write the noun in the singular in German with its singular article (der, die, das) and plural in German without `die` article.

- For adjectives: format like `🎨neu (alt)`. No need to say `adjective` or `antonym`. Use emoji 🎨 before the adjective. For each adjective, write the adjective in German and its antonym in German (hyphenated).

Now write back to let me know if you understand the instructions. Wait for my input.
